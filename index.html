        <p>Hi, my name is Manuela Alejandra RodrÃ­guez CÃ¡rdenas. I'm from Santander, Colombia, and I really enjoy
            painting and
            drawing in my free time. I'm currently studying Web and Computer Programming at BYU Pathway. I'm very happy
            to be able
            to learn about web design. I'm very excited about what I'm going to learn, how I can apply it, and how this
            will help me
            in the future. </p>
